Learnin' some python because I forgot and sure, forgetting things is normal (especially if you had ADHD), but it's not the best thing when it comes to a programming language that your academic career kind of revolves around, huh? 

I'm relearning using freeCodeCamp.org! Dunno, I just like how it's taught there. Direct, to the point and with understandable analogies.  ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶
